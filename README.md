# LangChain Company Info Extractor (LCEL Agentic Workflow)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses **LangChain's LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** to build an **intelligent agent** that can parse textual essays about company histories and automatically extract key business details, including:
- **Company Name**
- **Founding Date**
- **Founders**

Once extracted, the system formats the data into a **standardized CSV file** (`company_info.csv`) for easy integration with databases and other systems.

The solution leverages:
- **LCEL Runnable Interface** â€“ for modular and structured text processing
- **Tools and Tool Calling** â€“ for database-ready workflows
- **Agentic Workflow** â€“ for flexible, automated information extraction

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Develop a robust, scalable AI-powered pipeline that:
1. Processes text paragraphs individually.
2. Extracts structured company data.
3. Outputs a **CSV file** with the extracted details.
